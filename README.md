#Boris Bikes

An educational project for Makers Academy.  The project specifications are as follows:

## About Boris Bikes

London's Boris Bikes (well, 'Santander Cycles') are awesome. For a small fee, anyone can hire out a bike and ride it around London. Bikes are located at Docking Stations dotted throughout the city.

##Our Job

Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (congratulations! That was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan:

##System Requirements

Build the software for a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

## Our Plan

1) Develop the project in an agile and iterative way, following the challenges listed here: [Boris Bikes Challenges](https://github.com/MakersSweden/course/blob/master/boris_bikes/0_challenge_map.md)

2) Improve this README file, taking inspiratioin from [How to Write a Good README](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2304863/how-to-write-a-good-readme)
